This project is try to analyse Kobe Bryant's Shot History to get some interesting findings.
Also, predict shot probabilities.

This is a kaggle test, https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection.
It's simply a regression task.

I will try to first understand the data, then make a strategy to analyse it.
